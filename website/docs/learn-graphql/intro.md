# Intro

GraphQL is a new way of thinking about data and how to access it. It is a data query language that was invented by Facebook in 2012 to make it easier to deal with the complexity of data and state driven UI applications, combined with the scale of their workforce and codebase. GraphQL has since been open-sourced and is now used by many companies that have to deal with the same complexities.

GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine, instead it is an abstraction over the underlying APIs, expressed using a GraphQL schema. This higher level interface is more convenient for UI developers, as it allows them to access the data in a more consistent and predictable way. Additionally, a good GraphQL schema is focussed on expressing the actual domain models and the semantics thereof, rather than the underlying API data and the many disparate forms it can take. By carefully designing your schema, you can optimize your data retrieval to get exactly the data your UI needs, and _only_ that data.

This guide will teach you everything you need to know about GraphQL, including how to design schemas, how to implement field resolvers, and how to effectively use this to build data-driven user-interface applications.
